QUICK MAGADHEERA IMAGE SETUP GUIDE
===================================

STEP 1: Save Your Images
------------------------
From the images you showed me in the chat:

1. Right-click on the WARRIOR image (man with armor)
   - Save as: "warrior.jpg" or "warrior.png"

2. Right-click on the PRINCESS images (women in costumes)  
   - Save as: "princess1.jpg", "princess2.jpg", etc.

3. Save all images to your Desktop or Downloads folder

STEP 2: Run the Setup Tool
--------------------------
1. Open Command Prompt in the backend folder:
   cd "e:\MagaD 2\backend"

2. Run the image setup tool:
   python add_custom_images.py

3. Choose option 1 (Add images one by one)

4. When prompted, drag and drop your image files into the command prompt
   OR type the full path to each image

STEP 3: Alternative - Manual Method
-----------------------------------
If the tool doesn't work, you can manually copy images:

1. Copy your warrior image to: e:\MagaD 2\backend\characters\
   - Rename it to: Magadheera_Warrior.png

2. Copy your princess images to: e:\MagaD 2\backend\lovers\
   - Rename them to: Princess_1.png, Princess_2.png, etc.

STEP 4: Test the App
--------------------
1. Make sure backend is running:
   cd "e:\MagaD 2\backend"
   python app.py

2. Open your browser: http://localhost:3000

3. Test the face replacement!

EXPECTED RESULTS:
- Your face should be replaced with the warrior character
- Princess images should appear floating in the corner
- The transformation should be clearly visible

TROUBLESHOOTING:
- If images don't appear: Check file names and formats (PNG preferred)
- If face replacement doesn't work: The fallback system will still overlay images
- If you get errors: Make sure images are not corrupted and in supported formats

SUPPORTED FORMATS: PNG, JPG, JPEG
RECOMMENDED: PNG format with transparent backgrounds for best results

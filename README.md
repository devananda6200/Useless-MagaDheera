## Basic Details
### Team Name: Cinematic Coders

### Team Members
- Deva Nanda Nair - Toc H Institute of Science and Technology
- Abel Kurain - Toc H Institute of Science and Technology

### Project Description
Magadheera Past Life Reveal is a fun browser-based app that uses your webcam to detect your face, replace it with a Magadheera character to reveal ‚Äúwho you were‚Äù in a past life, and add your ‚Äúpast lover‚Äù beside you ‚Äî all while the iconic Magadheera title track plays.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People are living their lives without knowing their true past-life Magadheera identity.  
How can one make important life choices without this crucial information?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
By blending computer vision with cinematic flair, our app instantly uncovers your Magadheera alter ego and past lover ‚Äî because everyone deserves to know if they were a sword-wielding warrior in a previous birth.

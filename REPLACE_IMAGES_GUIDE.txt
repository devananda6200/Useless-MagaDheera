MAGADHEERA IMAGE REPLACEMENT GUIDE
==================================

STEP 1: Save Your Images
------------------------
From the images you showed me:

1. WARRIOR IMAGE (the man with armor and mustache):
   - Right-click and save as "Warrior_Magadheera.png"
   - This will replace faces in the app

2. PRINCESS IMAGES (the women in traditional costumes):
   - Save as "Princess_1.png" and "Princess_2.png" 
   - These will appear as past lovers

STEP 2: Prepare the Images
--------------------------
OPTIONAL (for best results):
- Resize warrior image to around 300x400 pixels
- Resize princess images to around 200x300 pixels
- Remove backgrounds if possible (use remove.bg website)

QUICK METHOD:
- Just save the images as PNG files
- The app will automatically resize them

STEP 3: Replace the Placeholder Images
--------------------------------------
1. Go to: e:\MagaD 2\backend\characters\
2. Delete the old placeholder files (Warrior1.png, etc.)
3. Copy your "Warrior_Magadheera.png" here

4. Go to: e:\MagaD 2\backend\lovers\
5. Delete the old placeholder files (Princess1.png, etc.) 
6. Copy your "Princess_1.png" and "Princess_2.png" here

STEP 4: Test the App
-------------------
1. Restart the backend server:
   cd "e:\MagaD 2\backend"
   python app.py

2. Test face detection:
   python debug_face_detection.py

3. Open the app: http://localhost:3000

STEP 5: Troubleshooting
----------------------
If face replacement still doesn't work:

1. Check the backend logs for errors
2. Make sure images are in PNG format
3. Try the debug script to see what's happening
4. The warrior image should completely cover your face
5. Princess images should appear in the top-right corner

EXPECTED RESULT:
- Your face gets replaced with the warrior character
- A princess image appears floating nearby
- The transformation should be clearly visible

If you need help with any step, let me know what error you're seeing!
